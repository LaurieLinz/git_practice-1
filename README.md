<h2>git_practice - The repository for beginners</h2>

I made this repository in September of 2015 while I was taking a RubyOnRails bootcamp
through [DaVinci Coders](http://www.davincicoders.com/). At the beginning of the class,
all of the students made blogs to document the topics we learned in class. I tried
writing articles that would help other aspiring developers understand complex topics.
One of the topics I wrote extensively about was using Git as a Distributed Version Control 
System (DVCS).

In order to illustrate some concepts, I urged my readers to create Git repositories on their
computers and play around with them. `git_practice` was created specifically to allow
my readers to try and practice forking repositories, if they wanted. Originally, it was made
in response to my [article](https://timsjpark.wordpress.com/2015/09/30/git-102-branching-out/)
about branching in Git. If you want to have more practice managing `upstream` repositories,
email me and I'd be happy to make some changes to `git_practice`. This way, you can see
how those changes appear to you own your local computer and the relationship between local,
origin, and upstream.

If you're looking to learn more about using Git, I encourage you to read my articles about
using Git. If you have comments or feedback about my articles, I'd be grateful for your
opinions. If you have questions, feel free to contact me at timsjpark@gmail.com.

Thanks, and best of luck on your journey as a developer!
